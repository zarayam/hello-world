# hello-world
this repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Hi! I am Mayank Shrivastava, a self-taught enthusiast with a strong commitment to continuous learning and professional growth. Although I initially learned my skills through online resources and practical experience on my PC, I now recognize the importance of using platforms like GitHub to showcase my work and collaborate with others.
My current academic goals have driven me to store and manage my projects in repositories. This unplanned yet exciting journey has been a testament to my determination and adaptability. I am dedicated to meeting the requirements as a candidate and hope that my talent and skills will be recognized.
